            <p>As a chiropractor, I embrace a holistic approach to wellness, in which health is not defined by the absence of disease, but by the full expression of life. I work with you to create an awareness of the body and the body-mind connection, so that you can confidently and productively enhance your health and the health of your family. Together, we can maintain optimal alignment of structure and proper tissue tone to facilitate the natural ease and mobility of your body. We can improve the quality of your life by increasing your body’s ability to adapt to deal with injuries and stresses from the environment. In essence, my goal is to help tune you up, so that you live your life full of vital energy and function at optimum capacity.</p>
            <p>Rather than prescribing drugs to treat conditions, I use my hands and an intimate knowledge of the body to assist the body in healing itself.</p>

            <p>We accomplish our goals of wellness and balance primarily through the art of chiropractic adjustment. Adjustments are specific applications of forces designed to facilitate the body’s correction of what chiropractors call “subluxation.” A subluxation is a misalignment of one or more of the 24 vertebra in the spinal column which causes alteration of nerve function and interference to the transmission of mental impulses resulting in a lessening of the body’s innate ability to express its maximum health potential. We use a wide variety of techniques:</p>

Throughout the pregnancy, he can help manage the the profound demands of the changing pregnant body to keep the expecting mama comfortable and to promote an uncomplicated and, hopefully, a quick and easy labor. No one is too young for chiropractic. Many of the common complaints of infancy have their origin in neuromechanical dysfunction and, when addressed early, can often be alleviated quickly and easily:</p>

            <p>Here at Phipps Family Chiropractic, we utilize an electrical modality called Frequency Specific Microcurrent. We may use it as an adjunct to the chiropractic and soft tissue modalities, or as a stand alone therapy to address acute or chronic musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction, as well as trauma induced pain.</p>
            <p class="push-top_half">The current involved in FSM is so minute (in the region of a millionth of an amp) it mimics the electrical processes that occur naturally in nerves. It is in no way injurious. The frequencies create tissue change by resonance. Resonance is the tendency of a system to oscillate at larger amplitudes in response to some frequencies and not others. Every mechanical system and every chemical bond has a resonant frequency. At resonant frequency — even small driving forces — can produce large amplitude vibrations. These large amplitude vibrations cause the system to oscillate so violently that it comes apart. A classic example of this would be the acoustic resonance displayed when someone with a high pitched song breaks lead glass crystal. The musical note sung matches the resonant frequency that binds the lead atoms together in crystal matrix. The resonance causes the atomic bonds to oscillate and the glass comes apart. Resonant phenomena occur with every type of vibration or wave and every type of bond and structure.</p>
            <p class="push-top_half">From a therapeutic perspective, if we know what bond or structure we want to disrupt or break apart, we can accomplish that goal with resonant frequencies. The bonds and structures we might want to disrupt could be the collagenous matrix of scar tissue, inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin 1, or the polypeptide chains of emotions.</p>
